"# Support-Vector-Machine" 

This project included "X_LinearSeparable.txt" and "Y_LinearSeparable.txt" that contains the trainingdata in text files.

There are a IPYNB File and a Python File, named Linear Hard-margin Support Vector Machine. 
They both contain the same code. The code imported numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, and qpsolvers libraries.

Note: qpsolvers library can be install from https://pypi.org/project/qpsolvers/.

I would recommand open the IPYNB file using Jupyter NoteBook.

The CSE353_Assignment7_Report.pdf file is my report for this assignment.
